# Project: Amazon E-Commerce Analytics SaaS
# Tech Stack: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Recharts
# Target: Professional B2B Amazon sellers (not gamers)

## Core Rules
- This is a B2B financial analytics tool, NOT a gaming dashboard
- Every calculation must be accurate to ±1% of real-world values
- NO fake data, NO mocked projections, NO simulated tracking
- If a feature requires API integration that doesn't exist yet, show placeholder text: "Available in Pro plan" — don't fake the data
- All financial numbers must have clear "How is this calculated?" tooltips

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript strict mode (no `any` types)
- Functional components only (no class components)
- Tailwind CSS for all styling (no inline styles, no CSS modules)
- Component names: PascalCase (e.g., `ProfitMarginCard.tsx`)
- File structure: `/components`, `/lib`, `/app`, `/types`

## Color Palette (B2B Professional)
- Success/Profit: #10b981 (green)
- Warning/Opportunity: #f59e0b (amber)
- Danger/Loss: #ef4444 (red)
- Primary: #3b82f6 (blue)
- Neutral: #6b7280 (gray)
- Background Dark: #0a0a0a
- Text Dark: #ffffff
- NO neon colors (cyan #00ffff, hot pink #ff69b4, purple #8b5cf6)

## Calculation Standards
- VAT calculation for Germany (19% standard rate)
- Amazon referral fees: 8-15% by category (default 15%)
- FBA fulfillment fees: size/weight-based (use lookup table)
- Profit Margin benchmarks: <8% POOR, 8-15% FAIR, 15-25% GOOD, 25%+ EXCELLENT
- ROI is calculated as: (Net Profit / Total Investment) × 100

## What NOT to do
- DO NOT create mocked/fake projection data
- DO NOT use gaming/neon colors
- DO NOT add "vs previous" metrics unless historical data exists
- DO NOT create duplicate files with similar names
- DO NOT leave incomplete code or comments like "// TODO: implement this"
- DO NOT add features I didn't ask for

## When making changes
1. Ask me to confirm the approach before implementing
2. Make changes to ONE file at a time
3. Show me the exact lines changed (not the entire file)
4. Wait for my approval before moving to the next file
5. If you're unsure about business logic, ASK ME first

## Testing checklist (you must verify after each change)
- [ ] Does the math add up correctly?
- [ ] Are colors from the B2B palette?
- [ ] Does dark mode work on this component?
- [ ] Is there a tooltip explaining the calculation?
- [ ] Did I test with realistic Amazon product data?
